.SH NAME
razor-panel \- Module of Razor-Qt: the faster and lighter QT Desktop Environment
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B razor-panel
.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
This module adds a panel to the desktop.
.P
Razor-Qt is an advanced, easy-to-use, and fast desktop environment based on Qt
technologies.
.P
The \fBRazor-Qt modules\fR are desktop independent tools, that do not accept option parsing, 
and operate as daemons for the local user for desktop specific operations. 
.P
As new project, Razor-Qt already contains the key DE components
and can be used separately, not all of them need to be used at once:
.P
 * Panel \fI(this)\fR
 * Desktop
 * Application launcher
 * Settings center
 * Sessions
 * Polkit handler
 * Display manager handler
.P
These components perform similar actions to those available in other desktop
environments, and their name is self-descriptive.  They are usually not launched
by hand but automatically, when choosing a Razor\-Qt session in the Display
Manager.
