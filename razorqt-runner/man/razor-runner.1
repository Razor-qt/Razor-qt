.SH DESCRIPTION
This module will allow you to launch an application by typing Alt+F2 its pressed on the keyboard.
.P
The \fBRazor-qt modules\fR are desktop independent tools, that do not accept option parsing, 
and operate as daemons for the local user for desktop specific operations. 
.P
\fBRazor-qt\fR is an advanced, easy-to-use, and fast desktop environment based on Qt
technologies. As new project, already contains the key DE components
and can be used separately, not all of them need to be used at once:
.P
 * Panel
 * Desktop
 * Application launcher \fI(this)\fR
 * Settings center
 * Sessions
 * Polkit handler
 * Display manager handler
.P
These components perform similar actions to those available in other desktop
environments, and their name is self-descriptive.  They are usually not launched
by hand but automatically, when choosing a Razor\-qt session in the Display
Manager.
